         <p>
             Traffic congestion is a constant challenge that affects travel times, air quality, and overall efficiency. 
             With population growth, economic development, and other continuous changes, the impact of traffic is becoming more problematic for travelers with each passing day.

             The intended plan is to create a website that navigates real-time traffic data, enabling users to view current traffic conditions. The website will provide many useful tools to the public, such as route optimization, commuter alerts, and real-time data access. 
             The features will be more advanced than Apple Maps, as it will frequently update the user with traffic and route changes. This differs from Apple Maps, as it lags often and inaccurately refreshes. 
             While looking at the webpage map, each category will be organized by a color code system. 
             This will allow the user to understand and determine what the best plan of action is. This can all be done by satellite connectivity, supplying precision.
